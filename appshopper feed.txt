			<b>Description:</b><br /><br />
			Stochastik is a full-featured Drum Machine with one outstanding difference.  Unlike any other Drum Machine, Stochastik lets you set a *probability* that a note will trigger for each step.  So, your basic beat can rock steady while accents and syncopation only happen every so often.Once you add chance into the mix, you can generate thousands of unique variations *automatically* in the time it takes to sequence (one, two or four) bars.  It's as easy as programming a static loop but it generates a dynamic track -- no more repetitive beats!  Over a thousand of high-quality samples are included, from classic analog drum machines of the past to pristine acoustic jazz and rock kits.  You can mix and match samples to create the perfect kit for each song. Plus, you can import your own samples through iTunes File Sharing, email or the Dropbox iPad App.Stochastik was made to share, so you can collaborate with your friends by emailing or uploading your song, pattern and kit settings.Stochastik plays well with other apps.  When you bounce your pattern to a wav file, it's automatically put in the clipboard for pasting into other apps.  With WIST, you can wirelessly sync with other devices.  With background audio, you can let Stochastik lay down the beat while you use a synth. MIDI is coming soon.☞ Audio Features:  ★ 15 Samples at a time, arranged in 3 banks of 5  ★ Over a thousand included drum, cymbal and percussion sounds -- acoustic, analog and digital. Learn more at http://stochastik.xitive.com/samples.html  ★ 32 Voices so you will have plenty of polyphony  ★ Bounce to 44.1Khz/16bit wav audio files  ★ Background Audio - the audio will continue to play when you switch apps.  ☆ Coming Soon: Export each drum as a separate track for mixing in your digital audio workstation☞ Sequencing Features:  ★ Stochastic programming of dynamic beats  ★ As many Patterns, Songs and Kits as you can fit on your device.  ★ Patterns can be 16, 32 or 64 steps long, and you can easily copy them to make tweaks.  ★ Quick touch pads on sequencer screen for jamming, recording your beats and making quick tweaks  ★ Sliders instead of knobs.  I wish every music app got rid of knobs  ★ Precise Entry (tap a number to bring up the keyboard) for maximum control over volume, pan, bpm and shuffle  ☆ Coming Soon: Mute / Solo, Set Volume per step.☞ Integration Features:  ★ Import/Export wav files, songs, patterns and kits through Email, iTunes File Sharing, the Dropbox iPad App and more  ★ AudioCopy &amp; Pasteboard support to use your drum patterns in GarageBand, BeatMaker and other compatible apps.  ★ Full &quot;Open In...&quot; support for working with other apps  ★ WIST so you can wirelessly sync Stochastik with other devices - http://www.korguser.net/wist/  ☆ Coming Soon: MIDI☞ Learning/Help Features:  ★ Screen overlay for quick reference of where everything is  ★ Full PDF Manual that introduces drum machines and describes how Stochastik's features work, in-depth  ★ Tutorial videos on YouTube  ★ Full E-Mail Support - support@xitive.com<br/><br/>

Speed boats, merchant ships, battlecruisers, even submarines and carriers are targets of your gunfire. You just need to click them, and then your gunfire will strike at the heart of these ships, turning them into scrap metal and sinking them into the deep ocean.★ Massive item variety to enhance the casually competitive experienceBe the first to own a powerful missile for major area destruction, or instantly become an indomitable juggernaut with one of many entertaining items that will change the course of battle and make your gameplay more fulfilling.★ Unique ships and medals of honorWhat type of ship do you prefer?

Here the game is reimagined by its original author in the style of an early 1980s coin-op arcade machine.  Of course this is a Minotaur Project game, so we ignore the limitations of such old hardware, borrowing just the style but presenting a slick, modern shooter that is a joy to play on iOS.As can be relied on in a Llamasoft game the controls are excellent and the gameplay fun, satisfying and rewarding.Gridrunner is OpenFeint enabled and supports leaderboards and achievements on both OpenFeint and GameCenter.Get your blasting trousers on and get ready to enjoy some classic shooting fun re-energised for the modern era.Another great Minotaur Project release.<br/><br/>

			Neoteria is a classic horizontal shoot em up game (shmup).  Multiple worlds, levels and aliens are waiting to be blasted.Our focus is on using your thumb like the 80's and 90's shooter games:  The faster your thumb, the faster you shoot !!  Give the controls a few minutes to get used to, they really work!Hidden worlds, different difficulty modes (un-lockable pilots)  AWESOME sound track and great retro graphics and sound effects.Game starts in easy mode, but Hard mode is as challenging as all our games are, getting the full 100% completion is not for the weak or casual gamer!<br/><br/>

			<b>Description:</b><br /><br />
			Shin Megami Tensei (literally True Goddess Reincarnation) is a role-playing video game from Atlus that was originally released on October 30, 1992 in Japan.  The game was extremely well received and would spawn a variety of sequels and spin offs.PLOTThe story is set in Tokyo in the year 199X. Demons from the nether-realm of Makai have found their way back to Earth, and as such have upset the balance of power. A charismatic Japanese leader attempts a coup d'état using these demons as a potent military force, forcing America to intervene with its military. The player, as the hero, becomes involved when sent a Devil Summoning Program via email which allows him to converse with and recruit demons to fight for him, storing them as digital data on his computer.In the aftermath of the ensuing destruction, the hero must decide what kind of world should be created on its ruins. Will he side with the angels and create a kingdom of absolute order that would last for a thousand years, or will he side with the demons and bring about an eternal anarchy, or will he choose neither, and destroy everyone who opposes him?GAMEPLAYThe game features two types of characters: Humans and Demons. A key facet of game play involves collecting demons. The human Hero acquires these demons via negotiation, bribing and coercion during battle. Once acquired, they can be stored in the party's portable computer and summoned for a small amount of money to be used in battle, and a constant feed of Magnetite (a secondary currency in the game) to be maintained outside of combat. If a demon is defeated during a battle, they must be revived before they can be used again.A notable aspect of the game is that the player can combine two or three demons and create a more powerful demon.HUMANS:Human characters can equip firearms with special ammo, melee weapons, and multiple pieces of armor from helmet to boots, although certain weapons can only be wielded by a character of a specific alignment. Humans are also the only ones capable of leveling up and having their Stats upgraded at the discretion of the player.DEMONS:There are a wide variety of demons from various mythologies in Shin Megami Tensei; each has its own unique statistics, and a skillset of up to three abilities or spells.!NOTEThis game is not translated and displays Japanese text only.<br/><br/>
